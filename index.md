Hi, I'm a student who enjoys coding and making games.

# game dev
Currently I am working on a game called [PushOps](https://youtu.be/g6DUlHYxsNE), a simple physics-based roguelike with no weapons.

You can join my [discord](https://discord.gg/Pd4nwmy2HJ) if you have any suggestions,
or want to follow development!

Steam takes 1 month to confirm my identity, so it'll be released in about a month, unless
I choose to release it sooner on itch or something.

Have a good one
